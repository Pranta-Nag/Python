***** del keyword
    used to delete object properties or object itself

    del s1.name     ; delete properties
    del s1          ; delete full object

***** private(like) attributes and methods
    - Conceptual implementation in Python
    - private attributes and methods are meant to be used only with in the class
        and are not accessible from outside the class

***** Inheritance
    when one class(chile) derives the properties and method of another class (base/parents)

    class Car:
    ...............
    ..........
    class ToyotoCar(Car):
    ....................
    .................

    - 3 types of inheritance
        - Single inheritance
        - Multi - level inheritance
        - Multiple inheritance

***** super method
    - super() method is used to access methods of the parent class

***** class method
    - a class method is bound to the class & receives the class as an implicit first argument
    - static method can not access or modify class state & generally for utility

   class Student:
            @classmethod
            def college(cls):
                    pass

***** Property decorator
    - we use @property decorator on any method in the class to use the method as a property

***** Polymorphism   -> operator overloading
    - when the same operator is allowed to a different meaning according to the context

    Operators & Dunder function:
        -> a + b  #addition  a.__add__(b)
        -> a - b  #subtraction  a.__sub__(b)
        -> a * b  #multiplication  a.__mul__(b)
        -> a / b  #divition  a.__truediv___(b)
        -> a % b  #modulus  a.__mod___(b)
